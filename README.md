# Constructor-Word-Guess
Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Constructor Hangman
# About this project
This project is a command line version of the classic Hangman game. This game uses similar logic to the browser-based Hangman game, but with this game, I created a command line version using Javascript constructor functions to create letter and word objects, the inquirer npm package to prompt users to guess a letter, and Node.js to run the Javascript code from the command line.
